	<br>
	<p>Puri is known by several names since the ancient times, 
		and was locally known as "Sri Kshetra" and
		the Jagannath temple is known as "Badadeula". 
		Puri and the Jagannath Temple were invaded 18 times by Muslim rulers,
		from the 7th century AD till the early 19th century with the
		objective of looting the treasures of the temple.
		The height of the temple is Odisha, including Puri and its temple, 
		were part of British India from 1803 till
		India attained independence in August 1947.

		the heirs of the House of Gajapati still perform the ritual duties of the temple.
